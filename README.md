# F21BC-Coursework
The aim of this assessment is to increase the understanding of artificial neural networks (ANNs)  and particle swarm optimisation (PSO), two biologically-inspired techniques which are taught in  the course. It involves implementing both ANN and PSO, experimentally investigating how PSO can  be used to optimise an ANN to carry out a specified task
